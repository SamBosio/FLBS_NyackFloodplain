Code to compile and organize Nyack Floodplain data meterological and hydrologic data into an archivable format.

Approach to start
- Figure out the structure of each df for HA07. Determine what is duplicate data and if anything has changed

Load the data
```{r}
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
library(dplyr)

# Get the data
temp <- read.delim("./Data/HA07/CR1000_HA07_Water - thru6_7_2016.dat", sep = ",", skip = 4, header = FALSE)

# Add the column headers
colnames(temp) <- colnames(read.delim("./Data/HA07/CR1000_HA07_Water - thru6_7_2016.dat", sep = ",", skip = 1, header = TRUE))

head(temp)

ha07_files <- list.files(path = "./Data/HA07")

ha07_water_files <- ha07_files[grepl("_Water", ha07_files)]

# Write a function to load in the water files
load_ha07_water_file <- function(file_name){
  # Read in the file
  temp <- read.delim(paste("./Data/HA07/", "file_name", sep ','), 
                     sep = ",", skip = 1, header = FASLE)
  
  colnames(temp) <- colnames(read.delim(paste("./Data/HA07/", "file_name", sep ','), 
                             sep = ",", skip = 1, header = TRUE))
  
  # Find the min and max sample dates in the file
  # Convert the timestamp variable to posix time
  temp$TIMESTAMP <- as.POSIXct(temp$TIMESTAMP, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") 
  
  # Find the max
  max(temp$TIMESTAMP)
  
}
  
  for(i in ha07_water_files){
  
}

```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
